# Connectable IO (Working Title)

Connectable IO is designed to offer unified interfaces for various resources, including storage, logging, queues, and more.
By abstracting these resources, it enables seamless interactions across different solutions and protocols, simplifying integration and usage.

## Concept

Connectable IO abstracts underlying protocols and storage solutions, aiming to provide a consistent interface for various resources.
By integrating necessary modules, users can interact with different storage solutions, logging systems, or queues through a single, unified approach.

## Features

- **Pluggability**

  Extend and adapt to different resources like storage solutions, logging systems, or queues by integrating the necessary modules.

- **Unified Interface**

  Interact using a consistent interface, irrespective of the specific resource type or underlying protocol.

- **Flexibility**

  Designed with adaptability in mind, it's suitable for projects that evolve over time.

- **Easy API**

  For users looking for a quick start, the Easy API offers functionalities without intricate setup.

## Use Cases

- **Dynamic Resource Management**

  Switch between different storage solutions, logging systems, or queues without altering the core logic.

- **Development and Testing**

  Mock resources or switch between solutions effortlessly during development and testing phases.

- **Custom Protocols**

  Integrate custom protocols or solutions by developing and incorporating the necessary modules.

- **Multi-Cloud Integration**

  Connectable IO is not only designed to reduce vendor lock-in but also to facilitate seamless operations across multiple cloud platforms,
  such as bridging systems between GCP and AWS.

  This capability ensures flexibility in cloud resource management and optimizes operational efficiency,
  allowing users to harness the best features from multiple cloud providers.

## Note

Connectable IO is in the development phase, and its API and features might undergo changes. Feedback and contributions are encouraged.
